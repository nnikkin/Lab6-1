This lab work required to write a program that would read contents of a binary file and process them into a heat map.
This Python code uses these libraries:
- struct: to read binary data and transform it into float values,
- numpy: to create a matrix with these values for the map,
- matplotlib: to visualise the processed data using a heat map
